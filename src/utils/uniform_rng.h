/*  uniform_rng - Uniform distribution random number generator.

    This class implements a no-shared-state random number generator that
    emits uniformly distributed numbers with high entropy. It solves the
    two problems of a simple `random() % limit`, which is a skewed
    distribution due to RAND_MAX typically not being evenly divisble by
    the limit, and worse, the lower bits of typical PRNGs having extremly
    low entropy â€“ the end result are grossly un-random number sequences.

    A `uniform_rng` instance carries its own state, unlike the `random()`
    function, and is thus thread-safe when no instance is shared between
    threads. It uses `random_r()` and `initstate_r()` from glibc.
